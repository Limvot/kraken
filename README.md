The Kraken Programming Language

(more information online at http://www.kraken-lang.org/ which is also under construction / needs to be updated / has a try-it-online feature for an older version without partial evaluation)

Currently developing the third iteration, a Scheme-like based on a functional Vau calculus partially-evaluated for efficency and compiling to WebAssembly.

*Heavily* inspiried by John Shutt's thesis: https://web.wpi.edu/Pubs/ETD/Available/etd-090110-124904/unrestricted/jshutt.pdf
with partial evaluation during compilation to make it efficient.
