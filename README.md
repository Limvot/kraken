The Kraken Programming Language

The Kraken Programming Language is in its infancy.

It has the following design goals:
	-Compiled
	-Clean
	-Fast (both running and writing)
	-Good for Systems (including Operating Systems) programming
	-Minimal "magic" code. (no runtime, other libraries automatically included)

It is inspired by C/C++, Python, and Go.
