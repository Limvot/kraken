Declaration of a pointer and multiplication are ambigious!
( T* a; maybe either a declaration or a multiplication)

Fix destructors being placed after return.
Fix functions before declaration? (in class? (this is from an old file))
Template instantiation without explicit type param
Fix // comment right before top level function declaration. Something to do
with the return as /* comment */ does not have that problem
for in or for each loops
Traits on aliases, maybe that keep their old traits?
