correctly importing / running tests is a nightmare with relative paths.

Namespaces
Imports allow renaming of either entire scope or individual members, and can import from within a scope

correct c genration for triple mutually recursive types across 2 files (wehre
A depends on B depends on C, but two of them are in the same file and there's
also pointers for the other two) Will need splitting into multiple C files to
be cleanest, I think)

Fix destructors being placed after return.
Fix functions before declaration? (in class? (this is from an old file))
Template instantiation without explicit type param
Fix // comment right before top level function declaration. Something to do
with the return as /* comment */ does not have that problem
for in or for each loops
Traits on aliases, maybe that keep their old traits?
